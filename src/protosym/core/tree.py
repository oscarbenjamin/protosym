class TreeExpr:
    """Base class for tree expressions.

    Every :class:`TreeExpr` is actually either an instance of :class:`TreeAtom`
    for atomic expressions or :class:`TreeNode` for compound expressions.

    >>> from protosym.core.tree import TreeAtom, TreeExpr, TreeNode

    <class 'protosym.core.tree.TreeNode'>
    >>> [isinstance(e, TreeExpr) for e in [f, one, f(one)]]
    [True, True, True]

    The verbose ``repr`` output seen above is deliberate so that the difference
    can clearly be seen between :class:`Atom`, :class:`TreeAtom` and higher
    level expression types. Prettier output can be found with ``str`` or
    ``print``.

    >>> print(f)
    f
    >>> print(one)
    1
    >>> print(f(one))
    f(1)

    Compound expressions are represented as :class:`TreeNode` instances and
    have a list of ``children`` that are themselves :class:`TreeExpr` whereas
    :class:`TreeAtom` has no children and holds an internal ``value`` that is
    of type :class:`Atom`.

    >>> expr
    TreeNode(TreeAtom(Function('f')), TreeAtom(Integer(1)))
    >>> expr.children
    (TreeAtom(Function('f')), TreeAtom(Integer(1)))
    >>> expr.children[0]
    TreeAtom(Function('f'))
    >>> expr.children[0].children
    ()
    >>> expr.children[0].value
    Function('f')
    >>> type(expr.children[0].value)
    <class 'protosym.core.atom.Atom'>

    Every :class:`TreeExpr` is either constructed from an :class:`Atom` using
    :class:`TreeAtom` or it is constructed as a compound expressions defined in
    terms of preexisting :class:`TreeExpr`. There are two equivalent ways to
    construct a :class:`TreeExpr`:

    >>> f(one) == TreeNode(f, one)
    True

    Every :class:`TreeExpr` is callable so this syntax can always be used even
    if it does not seem to make sense:

    >>> print(one(f))
    1(f)
    >>> one(f)
    TreeNode(TreeAtom(Integer(1)), TreeAtom(Function('f')))
